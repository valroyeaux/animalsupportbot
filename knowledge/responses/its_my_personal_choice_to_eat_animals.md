So is eating animals a personal choice or is it a little more complex than that? 

All acts come from personal choices. Some are inconsequential, like which socks to wear. Others have direct impacts on those who will suffer from that choice. It is your choice to eat animals. But by this logic it would then be morally justifiable to beat a dog or kick a cat, as it is a personal choice to do so. 

If someone makes the personal choice to abuse a dog, does that make it morally justifiable? You may not realize, but you are speaking about non-human animals as they were not sentient beings, who will receive the full harm of your choice. The same way a dog would suffer if you decided you have fun kicking them. There is no difference between a dog, a cat, and a farmed animal when it comes to their capacity to feel pain, despair, terror and fear.

And remember, eating animals causes harm to humans too. Slaughterhouses and flesh processing plants bring about <a href="https://foodispower.org/human-labor-slavery/slaughterhouse-workers/">labor issues</a> that are otherwise absent from developed countries (poor compensation, safety issues, psychological trauma, exploitation of poor and marginalized communities).

A personal choice will often affect others' personal choices too. When you declare it's yout personal choice to eat animal products, what about the personal choice of every other creature, human and non-human alike, whose life is treated as inferior and meaningless just  for minutes of sensorial pleasure that can easily be obtained from mure more ethical sources? 

It is not morally justifiable to murder just because the murderer personally made the choice to murder. It is not morally justifiable to rape just because the rapist personally made the choice to commit the act of rape. It is not morally justifiable to kick and beat a dog just because the abuser personally made the choice to kick and beat the dog and it is not morally justifiable to pay for animals to be exploited and killed, just because a non-vegan personally made the choice to pay for animals to be exploited and killed.
