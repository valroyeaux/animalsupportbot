The food chains within nature are incredibly important, they symbolise something that is part of the natural order and exists within an eco-system. They help to maintain healthy populations of animals and ensure that the natural ecology is balanced. 

The food chains in nature are a consequence of the dynamics of the wild world. The predator needs to kill the prey to survive. Prey needs to kill to defend themselves. However, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-422784/How-leopard-changed-spots---saved-baby-baboon.html">not even predators are without mercy</a>. That is because once the <b>need</b> to kill for survive is remove from the equation, being stronger is not a justification for killing mindlessly.

Flesh and other animal product are <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/proceedings-of-the-nutrition-society/article/plantbased-diets-and-longterm-health-findings-from-the-epicoxford-study/771ED5439481A68AD92BF40E8B1EF7E6"><b>not</b> needed for nutrition</a>. Humankind consumes it purely for sensory pleasure. Therefore, we don’t have to kill anyone to live. Our position as the species on the top of the food chain doesn't have to use our dominance to kill others. 

Not only we are the most fit - we are rghe only ones capable of being moral agents. This means we can weigh the consequences and impact of our actions.  We can make decisions based on a notion of right and wrong and most importantly we can be held accountable for the actions that we make. So, as the dominant species, we can use our power to look after others and create a better world - in fact, we have a moral obligation to. Our moral agency dictates to us that when we are in a situation where we have the choice to not inflict unnecessary suffering we can and should be held accountable if we actively choose to inflict unnecessary suffering instead.

Finally, what we do to is far removed from the natural world. We selectively breed, artificially inseminate, mutilate and farm them, before driving them in trucks to the slaughterhouse where we hang them upside down, kill them and drain them of their blood is about as far removed from nature as possible and does not resemble anything like a food chain. 

Every human atrocity committed has come under the illusion of self-appointed power, whether it be Nazis believing they are superior to Jewish people, white people believing they are superior to black people, one religion believing they are superior to another religion or humans believing that they are superior to animals. The food chain excuse adopts the ‘might means right’ way of thinking, with people believing that because we have the physical ability to enslave and exploit others we are then morally justified to do so. But being in the position of power means that we have a responsibility to care for the vulnerable, we have a moral obligation to care and look after those weaker or less able than we are.
